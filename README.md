| name | Printing out the public State Variable |

## Dependencies

* Node.js: It allows to install all Dependencies and run the Client-side Application
* Truffle Framework: A Framework for Creating Ethereum Smart Contracts. It allows creating, testing and deploying Smart
  Contracts on a Blockchain
* Ganache: It provides a locally Blockchain for Testing Purpose
* MetaMask: A Browser Extension to connect with the Blockchain. It contains the Wallet for Ethereum
* Web3.js Connect the Browser with MetaMask Extension to the Blockchain based Website

### Update Dependencies (Node.js Modules)

* npm install -g npm-check-updates: Installing the Node.js-Check-Updates Module
* ncu â€“u: This will update the package.json File as the latest Versions available in npm Repositories on Web
* npm install: This will update the local node_modules Repository with the Versions present in package.json
* npm install --package-lock-only: This will update the Versions present in package-lock.json

## Solidity
### Events
* Events causes the Arguments to be stored in the Log of the Transaction
* The Log of the Transaction exists as long as the Block in the Blockchain exists (in Theory forever)
* Evetns log Changes into the Blockchain and make it true forever

### Address
* Every Account and Smart Contract has an Address
* It is used to send and receive Ether from one Account to another

### Mapping
* Data Type used to store Associations that allow to get a Value for a corresponding Key

### Require
* Convenience Function that guarantees Vailidity of Conditions that cannot be detected before Execution
